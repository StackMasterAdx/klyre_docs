# Errors
<p style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
If the API may encounter errors during transactions. These errors are categorized into Content Validation Errors and Processor Errors, each provides code associated with the description of the error to help diagnose and resolve issues in the payment process.
</p>
## Content Validation Errors
<p style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
Content Validation Errors occur when there are problems with the data or parameters provided in the payment request. These errors range from empty authentication details to invalid values for fields such as first name, last name, address, phone number, or invalid amounts. These errors serve as indicators for developers and users to validate and ensure the accuracy and completeness of the payment information being submitted. By addressing these errors, users can ensure the integrity of the payment data and increase the chances of successful transactions.
</p>
## Processor Errors
<p style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
Processor Errors, on the other hand, relate to issues encountered during the processing of the payment request by the underlying payment processor. These errors cover a wide range of scenarios, including invalid card numbers, processing failures, authentication errors, limit violations, and various other specific error conditions. Processor Errors provide insights into the specific reason for the failure and help in troubleshooting and resolving the issue with the payment processor's support or technical team.

In both cases, it is essential to build applications with logic built around error-handling mechanisms in place to capture and process these errors. Proper error handling can include logging the error details, providing clear error messages to users, and implementing fallback or recovery strategies to minimize the impact on the payment flow. By effectively addressing and resolving these errors, businesses can ensure a smooth and reliable payment experience for their customers.
